Question:
- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build
a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

Answer:
- Java does NOT allow you to create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build
a DVD by category because the parameter for the constructor for both cases are String. You can however create a constructor method to build  DVD by length though since the parameter would be int and it's different from String, making a different constructor. This is an example of Overriding.
